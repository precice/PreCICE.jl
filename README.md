This package provides Julia language bindings for the C++ library [preCICE](https://github.com/precice/precice). It is a Julia package that wraps the API of preCICE.

## Adding and using the package

The Julia bindings for preCICE can be used by either by adding them as a package in a Julia environment or also directly including the package in a Julia script. For both type of usages preCICE needs to be installed on the system. For preCICE installation, have a look at the [installation documentation](https://precice.org/installation-overview.html).

### Adding the package

Add the Julia bindings to the Julia environment in the following way:

```julia
julia> ]
pkg> add PreCICE 
Then exit the package mode with ðŸ”™ or Ctrl + c
julia> using PreCICE
```

Alternatively you can also include the package in a Julia script in the following way:

```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add("PreCICE")
using PreCICE
```

### Adding the package from a local folder

If you have cloned or downloaded the Julia bindings on your local machine, add the Julia bindings to your Julia environment in the following way:

```julia-repl
julia> ]
pkg> add <path-to-repository>
Then exit the package mode with ðŸ”™ or Ctrl + c
julia> using PreCICE
```

Alternatively, you can install a specific branch of this repository with the following command:
```julia-repl
pkg> add https://github.com/precice/PreCICE.jl#<branch-name>
```

## Troubleshooting

If preCICE is installed at a custom path, errors of the form ```ERROR: could not load library "/..."``` can occur after adding the Julia bindings package. Make sure the preCICE library is in the system library path through `echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and otherwise update the variable with the correct path.

```bash
~$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path-to-precice.so>
```

A different way to fix this error is to set the custom path of the preCICE installation through the environment variable `PRECICE_JL_BINARY`. Afterwards you need to rebuild this package:

```julia-repl
~$ export PRECICE_JL_BINARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
~$ julia (--project)
julia> ]
pkg> build PreCICE
julia> using PreCICE
...
```

## Usage

The [solverdummy](https://github.com/precice/julia-bindings/tree/main/solverdummy) shows an example of how to use the Julia bindings for preCICE.

## Testing PreCICE.jl

To test the bindings run:
```julia-repl
julia> ]
pkg> test PreCICE
```

This checks if the preCICE bindings can be found and accessed correctly.
You can also test the full functionality of PreCICE.jl. If not set up, the output of the previous test shows an info on what command you need to execute. It will be along the lines of:
```
cd /home/<user>/.julia/packages/PreCICE/<code>/test && make
```
After this, you can run the tests again, resulting individual 22 tests being executed.

## Dependencies

This package works with official Julia binaries listed below. See the [Platform Specific Instructions for official Binaries](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/)  or [Julia's documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/) if you are not sure how to download them.

## Supported versions

The package is tested for Julia versions `1.6.0`, `1.6.5`, `1.7.0` and the two newest [Julia releases](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/releases). Julia versions prior to `v1.6.0` are not supported.

[Unofficial Julia binaries](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/#platform_specific_instructions_for_unofficial_binaries) may not be compatible.

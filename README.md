This package provides Julia language bindings for the C++ library [preCICE](https://github.com/precice/precice). It is a Julia package that wraps the API of preCICE.

## Adding and using the package

You can use the Julia bindings for preCICE by adding them as a package in a Julia environment or also directly including the package in a Julia script. For both type of usages you need to have preCICE installed on the system. For preCICE installation you can look at the [installation documentation](https://precice.org/installation-overview.html). 

### Adding the package using the repository link

Add the Julia bindings to the Julia environment in the following way:

```julia
julia> ]
pkg> add https://github.com/precice/julia-bindings.git 
Then exit the package mode with ðŸ”™ or Ctrl + c
julia> using PreCICE
```

Alternatively you can also include the package in a Julia script in the following way:

```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/precice/julia-bindings.git")
using PreCICE
```

### Adding the package from a local folder

If you have cloned or downloaded the Julia bindings on your local machine, add the Julia bindings to your Julia environment in the following way:

```julia
julia> ]
pkg> add <path-to-repository>
Then exit the package mode with ðŸ”™ or Ctrl + c
julia> using PreCICE
```

## Adding the package when preCICE is installed at a custom path

If you installed preCICE at a custom path, errors of the form ```ERROR: could not load library "/..."``` can occur after adding the Julia bindings package.

Set your custom path through the environment variable `PRECICE_JL_BINARY` and rebuild this package:

```julia
~$ export PRECICE_JL_BINARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
~$ julia (--project)
julia> ]
pkg> build PreCICE
julia> using PreCICE
...
```


## Usage

You can look at [solverdummy](https://github.com/precice/julia-bindings/tree/main/solverdummy) as an example of how to use the Julia bindings for preCICE.

## Testing new features that are on branches of this repository

To use a certain branch of this package, add `#branchname` after the package url, for example if the branch `mpi-parallelization` is to be tested:

```julia
julia> ]
pkg> add https://github.com/precice/julia-bindings.git#mpi-parallelization
Then exit the package mode with ðŸ”™ or Ctrl + c
julia> using PreCICE
```
